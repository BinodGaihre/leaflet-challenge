# leaflet-challenge
- In this challenge, we have visualized USGS data (an earthquake dataset) by creating map that plots all the earthquake data using leaflet.
- There are two folder Leaflet-Part-1 and Leaflet-Part-2.
    1. first one for all the earthquakes from our dataset based on their longitude and latidude.
    2. second one to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
- Each folder contain one static folder with two folders inside it css folder containing styling and js for javascrit file along with
index.html to see the map.
